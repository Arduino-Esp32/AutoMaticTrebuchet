I was making a  AutoMaticTrebuchet using the Arduino Uno.
This took me 2 months to make and in the end I was able to do it with my dad.
The contraction was difficult but the coding was quite easy and hard at the same time.
The code is there and a few pictures and videos.
I am really proud of my project.

Thanks
